[Demo:  Zoom To widget](http://swingley.github.com/zoomto-widget/)

The Zoom To widget zooms to a state or county in the United States. This is done with a drop down button that contains two combo boxes (filtering selects in Dojo terms): one to select a state, and one to select a county. Once a state or county is selected, the map zooms to that state or county.

State and county extents are retrieved from JSON files via a dojo data store. Web Mercator extents are used by default. If the map's spatial reference doesn't match the spatial reference of the extents in the JSON file, the extent is sent to a geometry service to be projected before being passed to the map. Using a non-Web Mercator map requires additional configuration as you have to supply a URL for a geometry service to project extents, or you have to supply your own JSON file with extents.

The widget is created from a page that includes an ArcGIS API for JavaScript map. Refer to index.html to see code required to use the widget in a web page.
